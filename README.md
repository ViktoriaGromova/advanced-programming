# Advanced Programming in C++
This repository was created for the development of an advanced c++ course. This course is based on materials from lectures from MIPT. Videos of the lectures can be found on [YooTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%83%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%B9+c%2B%2B).

This repository includes: 
1) Lecture notes. They are located in the `cplusplus-lessons` folder.
2) Practical tasks. Each task has a separate folder. The description and instructions for the configuration and assembly of each task can be found inside the project in a separate README.
